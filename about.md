Hi, I'm **Alfonso**. That's all the personal stuff that I'm going to say.

*Just kidding.*

I've worked for many years in web development, but right now I'm focused in Computer Science research, mainly in algorithms and data structures, low level programming and a few things related with mathematics. I'm especially interested in developing algorithms considering very seriously performance related issues like cache faults, branch mispredictions or operation costs.

And about why I write this blog, well, Who cares?

Feel free to contact me : alfonso.cama@hotmail.com

*Good luck.*
